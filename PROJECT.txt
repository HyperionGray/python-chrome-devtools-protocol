Python Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) Library

This is a Python library that provides type wrappers for the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
The project generates Python bindings from the official CDP JSON specifications.

Project Type: Python Library
Build System: Poetry + Makefile
Primary Purpose: Provide typed Python interfaces for Chrome DevTools Protocol

Key Components:
- cdp/ - Generated Python modules for each CDP domain
- generator/ - Code generation scripts that create the CDP bindings
- docs/ - Sphinx documentation
- test/ - Test suites for both generated code and generator

Build Workflow:
1. Generate CDP bindings from JSON specs (make generate)
2. Run type checking (make mypy-cdp, make mypy-generate)  
3. Run tests (make test-cdp, make test-generate)
4. Test imports (make test-import)
5. Build documentation (make docs)

This project follows standard Python library patterns and uses Poetry for dependency
management. The pf files in this repository provide simple wrappers around the
existing Makefile targets for organizational consistency.
